1. Candidate Flow
The primary goal for the candidate is to prepare for interviews, analyze their resume, and track their performance.

Candidate Dashboard
Purpose: This is the central hub for the user. It shows high-level metrics like total interviews taken, average AI score, and an "Improvement Rate" to track progress over time.

Flow: From here, a candidate can quickly jump into a mock interview, check their skill levels (React, Communication, etc.), or see which interviews they have coming up.

Resume Upload & AI Analysis
Purpose: A specialized tool where candidates drop their CVs.

Flow: The AI performs Skill Extraction (what you know), Gap Analysis (what you're missing for specific roles), and Interview Prep (generating personalized questions based on the resume).

AI Mock Interview
Purpose: The practice environment. It shows the interview's parameters (position, duration, difficulty) and performs a system check for camera/mic.

Flow: Once the candidate clicks "Start Interview," they likely interact with an AI bot that evaluates their verbal and non-verbal responses in real-time.

Interview History
Purpose: A detailed log of every session.

Flow: It distinguishes between Mock (practice) and Live (real recruiter) sessions. Each entry shows the AI-generated score, allowing the candidate to review specific feedback from past performances.

2. HR Manager Flow
The HR side is designed for "Data-Driven Hiring," using AI scores to filter through large pools of applicants quickly.

HR Dashboard
Purpose: A bird's-eye view of the entire recruitment funnel. It tracks open positions, active candidates, and how many offers have been extended.

Flow: Recruiter uses this to see "Recent Applications" and check the "Interviews This Week" calendar to stay on top of the schedule.

Job Positions
Purpose: Managing the actual job listings.

Flow: The HR manager creates positions (e.g., "Senior Full Stack Developer"), sets the salary range, and monitors how many applicants have applied versus how many are "Qualified" based on AI screening.

Candidates Pipeline
Purpose: The "Review" center.

Flow: This page lists all individuals in the pipeline. The most critical feature here is the AI Score. Instead of reading 147 resumes manually, the recruiter can sort by score to find the top talent (like Alex Martinez at 92%) and move them to the "Qualified" or "In Interview" status.

The Integrated System Flow
Job Creation: HR creates a position in the Job Positions tab.

Application: Candidates find the job and upload their resume in the Resume tab.

Preparation: Candidates use the Mock Interview feature to practice and improve their "Top Skills" stats.

Screening: The AI automatically scores the candidate's resume and mock interview performance.

Review: HR checks the Candidates list, sees high AI scores, and reviews the candidate's history.

Selection: HR schedules a Live Interview (visible on the HR Dashboard) to make the final hiring decision.
